# Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using ML

In this notebook, we're going to predict the sales price of bulldozers.

## 1. Problem definition

> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its attributes and historical sales of bulldozers at auctions

## 2. Data

The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition:

There are 3 main datasets:

* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012.
* Test.csv is the test set, which contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012.

## 3. Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
